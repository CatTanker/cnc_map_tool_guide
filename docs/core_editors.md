This section covers the core editors that have been an essential part of mapping for the past 20+ years. I highly recommend checking the 'Modern Options' page as well, as this will significantly improve the user experience of the following editors, and offer an alternative.

The 'Assistive Tools' page is fairly self explanatory. These tools cannot replace a core editor, but may significantly help your workflow through the utilities they provide.

### [FA2] Final Alert 2:

The Map Editor for Yuris Revenge. <br />
Contains patches which have been developed by multiple members of the community <br />
The patched FA2 link provides a clean working FA2 setup for the vanilla game (RA2/YR Unmodded)
The FA2Sp link directs you to the extension itself, which can be dropped into a mod's FA2, and should work fine assuming you check the changelog under releases <br />

### [FS] Final Sun:

Description: The necessary Map Editor for Tiberian Sun + Firestorm <br />
The Patched FS option is directly compatible with TS. It contains some of fa2sp's features, so it is a massive improvement over the unmodded editor.
The toolkit option attempts to provide a direct application using several of the tools listed below. The forum contains a link to an older fork of FS that may be useful to some.
The Tiberian Sun Client [TSC] also includes a build.
