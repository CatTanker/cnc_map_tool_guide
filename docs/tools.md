# Tools
## Required Map Editors

### [FA2] Final Alert 2:

The Map Editor for Yuris Revenge. <br />
Contains patches which have been developed by multiple members of the community <br />
The patched FA2 link provides a clean working FA2 setup for the vanilla game (RA2/YR Unmodded)
The FA2Sp link directs you to the extension itself, which can be dropped into a mod's FA2, and should work fine assuming you check the changelog under releases <br />

### [FS] Final Sun:

Description: The necessary Map Editor for Tiberian Sun + Firestorm <br />
The Patched FS option is directly compatible with TS. It contains some of fa2sp's features, so it is a massive improvement over the unmodded editor.
The toolkit option attempts to provide a direct application using several of the tools listed below. The forum contains a link to an older fork of FS that may be useful to some.
The Tiberian Sun Client [TSC] also includes a build.

### Editor Modifications:
#### DDraw Renderer

Instead of using the system DDraw, FA2 and FS can instead use a local proxy DDraw.dll, improving the editor's speed considerably, which is especially useful for resource-heavy maps.
Several of the *patched* map editors have this included but not in use, so check your map editor's folder as the files may already exist, such as in a "ForWindows10" folder, containing a pre-configured setup. if you want an un-configured setup for unknown reasons, or simply want to know more about the wrapper, check the unconfigured link below. I also included a direct download, although i have lost which thread this is on so i am unable to verify if it is the latest download.

#### Dark and Custom themes

Assuming you use the Sp version of the editor, it is certainly possible to modify the theme. This comes with a risk however, as on windows you have to modify your entire system's theme in order to achieve this, and if you install the wrong theme for your windows version, your windows updates and therefore becomes incompatible with the theme you are using, or of course simply mess something up you could easily break your system and be left to the mercy of restore points or a fresh boot. There are a number of windows 'ricing' tutorials and lists online, but a lot of recommendations from major publishers seem to only use what windows 10+ already allows you to do, which doesn't really help you. I found and recommend [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/168y7dn/ultimate_simplified_guide_how_to_make_windows_10/) as it describes most options available for modernising windows 10, with a lot being applicable to Windows 11 as well. While you are of course free to read the entire section, you should focus on the `Before Starting` and the themes section. I have included below an example of what FA2 looks like using dark theme from [rectify11](https://rectify11.net) on Windows 11.

Another example is After Dark CC Blue, provided by SCIPCION on Windows 10

Ultimately it is your decision if you wish to risk modifying windows in such a way, especially with WAE as a modern alternative. I have also written advice on applying a dark theme in [linux](linux.md), however the options are more limited.

## Modern Alternatives:

### World Altering Editor : <br />
Author: Rampastring + Contributors  <br />
Description: The World Altering Editor (WAE) is an open source replacement to the traditional editors. unlike the originals, it is built using a modern code base, and as a result of being open source it does not require the use of dll injection to improve. Formerly known as the DTA Scenario Editor, as it was built for [Dawn of the Tiberium Age](https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-dawn-of-the-tiberium-age), it has since been growing in compatability for TS/YR. A release for TSClient and Vanilla YR both available on the the releases page. As of v0.9.6 the editor now has a voxel renderer, meaning that the editor can effectively replace FA2 for all quality PCs using win7 or later, although it is arguably still behind in a few areas.
