# Welcome
## Beginnings

The project started as a list of all the relevant mapping resources i have discovered, placed inside my mapping discord server in a dedicated channel. Due to discord's limitations, and a few other factors, I decided it was not wise to lock my first draft of information up in a discord server, and so I added it to github. While gists was also an option, it did not have the complexity and collaboration element that i wanted this project to achieve.

Over time i have worked on the list, adding new entries and improving it's relevance by mentioning areas such as the [World Altering Editor](https://github.com/Rampastring/WorldAlteringEditor).

Since i frequently use linux as a daily driver, and have been since mid 2020, i realised there was relatively little formalised information about running WW 2.5D games on linux, and what there was tended to be un-coordinated. As with most linux users, I broke my build several times, and as a result got tired of having to dig out the same information each time in order to make a game somewhat run through trial and error. In 2023 I started my writeup, and as of October I pushed the first edition of my linux guide. I have since worked on expanding and simplifying the guide into the product that it is today.

After suggestions to move to ReadTheDocs i finally took on this task in December 2023, and a month on I have finished the transition, meaning all materials are now re-formated and are on this web page.

I hope you find the spectrum of information available to be useful.
