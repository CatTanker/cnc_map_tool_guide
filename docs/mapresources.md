## Noteworthy Projects:


MadHQ has remade the RA2 Allied and Soviet Campaigns entirely, designed for the vanilla game. These are significantly larger than their predecesors, and do offer a long playthrough. These are hosted in [MadHQ's Graveyard](http://zombapro.ppmsite.com/index.php?page=Missions)

Almost Perfect Red Alert 2 (APRA2) is a fan project to produce a Red Alert 2 campaign in Mental Omega.  <br />
The team has made a nearly complete lineup of high quality work that is publicly available, and consists of quite a few skilled and experienced mappers who can likely offer experience and advice. An excellent benchmark for any modern campaign developers who intend to use a mod's features (including assets and engine extensions) to create something adventurous. You can find out more on their [discord](https://discord.gg/Z7HsWA5pTv)  <br />

Dawn of the Tiberium Age has been working on recreating the [original TD Campaigns](https://www.moddb.com/mods/thedawnofthetiberiumage/news/annoucingourtdgdicampaigncoopremake) Co-Op maps, which is representative of what can be achieved even on TS and with online limitations. You can also find out more on their [discord](https://discord.gg/YczsdZC) <br />


Flipped Missions is a mod for YR which reverses the roles of original YR missions so you play as the other side, of course with some methods to make this playable and not an instant win against an Ai conyard. You can find out more on their [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/ra2fm) and [discord](https://discord.gg/tYuP82S) <br />
